# r6-ops-board

Two small Docker services that track Rainbow Six Siege esports from public data, just polling public sources on a schedule. (Repo was named `r6-notifier` until the site generator grew past being a side feature of the notifier — renamed to describe the whole project instead of one service.)

**🎮 Live page: [r6.vaultinc.fr](https://r6.vaultinc.fr/)** (also reachable at [revanito.github.io/r6-ops-board](https://revanito.github.io/r6-ops-board/) — GitHub Pages serves both, one isn't a redirect of the other)

## What it does

**`r6-notifier`** — posts to a Discord webhook, twice a day (default 08:00 / 20:00 Europe/Paris):
- when a watched Twitch channel (default `rainbow6`) goes live
- upcoming matches in the next ~30 hours (teams, tournament, time, Twitch link)

**`r6-site`** — regenerates a static results/schedule page and pushes it to `docs/` on this repo's `main` branch, only when the rendered page actually changed. GitHub Pages serves that folder.

Sections: Live now, Active drops, Upcoming today, Upcoming (next 30 days), Playoff bracket (while one's relevant), Recent results (last 14 days). Every match card shows both teams' country flags and org logos; a finished match's winning map score gets a green highlight and a link to its siege.gg recap page. While a tournament has a match live, upcoming soon, or recently finished, a right-hand sidebar appears with that tournament's banner, prize pool/region/venue info, and the full participating-teams list - it fades away on its own once nothing's close enough in time to be "the" relevant event, no manual toggling needed.

Rebuild frequency adapts automatically: every `SITE_BUILD_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (10) while a match is live or one's scheduled to start within `ACTIVE_LOOKAHEAD_HOURS` (48h). Outside of that, it rebuilds once daily at local midnight (`TZ_NAME`) instead of on a rolling interval, so quiet stretches between tournaments still get one guaranteed refresh a day - and the "Upcoming" section (independent of this active/idle split) still updates on every single build, so a newly-announced match shows up on the very next build regardless of which mode it's in.

Two more pages, linked from the nav bar on every page: **Drops Archive** (`drops.html`) — every drops campaign ever seen, active or expired, grouped by campaign — and **Past Events** (`events.html` → `events/<id>-<slug>.html`) — every tournament this site has ever featured as its active one, each with a permanent snapshot of its final bracket and competition info. Both are built from small JSON files (`archive/drops.json`, `archive/tournaments.json`, committed alongside `docs/`) that accumulate over time from data the live page is fetching anyway, so archiving costs no extra requests and updates on the same cadence as everything else - no separate refresh schedule needed.

## Data sources

- **Ubisoft's official esports page** — authoritative (has a real `live` flag and final scores), but only covers whatever event Ubisoft is currently spotlighting on that page.
- **[Liquipedia](https://liquipedia.net/rainbowsix/Liquipedia:Matches)** — much broader coverage (every tracked tournament), but occasionally lags on team reveals for not-yet-started bracket slots, and its "is this live" signal isn't trustworthy on its own.
- **[siege.gg](https://siege.gg/matches)** — team country flags, org logos, per-map result score, a link to each match's recap page, and (via its per-competition and per-match APIs) the playoff bracket and tournament info sidebar.
- **[twitchdrops.app](https://twitchdrops.app/game/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege)** - Live campaigns for drops, for extracting the drop data.

Ubisoft's feed wins on overlap and is the *only* source trusted for "live right now"; Liquipedia fills in everything Ubisoft's narrow feed doesn't cover; siege.gg enriches whatever's left with flags/logos/links regardless of which of the first two supplied the match. Matches are de-duplicated by timestamp, and `TBD vs TBD` placeholder slots from Liquipedia are dropped in favor of Ubisoft's resolved data when available.

## Setup

1. Create a Discord webhook: channel Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook → copy the URL.
2. Register a free Twitch app at [dev.twitch.tv/console/apps](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) to get a Client ID + Secret (Client Credentials flow — no user login, no special permissions, just app registration).
3. Generate a fine-grained GitHub Personal Access Token scoped to just this repo, with **Contents: Read and write** — Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens.
4. Enable GitHub Pages on this repo: Settings → Pages → Source: "Deploy from a branch" → Branch: `main`, folder: `/docs` → Save. (The page won't render until `r6-site` pushes its first `docs/index.html` — see below.)
5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values from steps 1–3.
6. `docker compose up -d --build`

That starts both services. State (which matches/live-transitions were already notified) is persisted in `./data/state.json`; the site generator's own git clone lives in `./site-repo/`.

**Optional: custom domain.** Add a `CNAME` record for your subdomain pointing at `<username>.github.io` (no trailing content, GitHub's own DNS resolves the rest), then Settings → Pages → Custom domain → enter the subdomain → Save. GitHub writes a `CNAME` file into `docs/` automatically once saved - `webgen.py` never touches or deletes files it didn't write, so it survives every future rebuild untouched. GitHub auto-issues an HTTPS cert once its DNS check passes (usually minutes after the DNS record itself has propagated); the plain `github.io` URL keeps serving the exact same content the whole time, unaffected.

## Notes

- `main.py` is the Discord notifier; `webgen.py` is the site generator — deliberately not named `site.py`, since that shadows Python's built-in `site` module.
- `sources.py` holds all the fetch/merge/classify logic shared by both.
- Set `RUN_ON_START=true` in `.env` to make either service run once immediately on startup instead of waiting for its first scheduled slot — useful when testing.
- siege.gg's match data comes from its public JSON API (`/api/stats/matches`, `/api/stats/competitions/<id>/matches`). Its per-competition info (prize pool, region, venue, participating teams) has no API - it's scraped out of the competition page's embedded Nuxt payload instead, so that part is more likely to break if siege.gg changes their frontend.
- Team names aren't always spelled identically across sources (e.g. "DarkZero" vs "DarkZero Esports"), so flags/logos/results are matched by a normalized team name, not an exact string match.
- The drops/events archives only start accumulating from whenever this feature first ran - there's no way to backfill genuinely past history the site never saw live, since twitchdrops.app and the bracket/sidebar only ever expose "current" data.
